# Recursion

## pow (Fall 2011 Quiz 0)

Complete the implementation of `pow` below in such a way that the function returns x^y (i.e., `x` raised to the power of `y`) unless `x` or `y` (or both) is negative, in which case the function should instead return `-1`. Recall that, mathematically, x^0 is 1 and that x^1 is x. You needn't worry about integer overflow. Suffice it to say that you may not call the version of `pow` that's declared in `math.h`!

```c
int pow(int x, int y)
{












}
```

## Fibonacci

We can define the Fibonacci numbers as such:

* The 0th and 1st Fibonacci numbers are both 1.
* Every subsequent Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous 2 Fibonacci numbers.

So the first few Fibonacci numbers are:

```
Index   0  1  2  3  4  5
Number  1  1  2  3  5  8
```

Write a recursive function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. Assume  you'll only be given positive numbers. **You can't use loops.**

* `fibonacci(5)` should return `8`
* `fibonacci(1)` should return `1`
* `fibonacci(0)` should return `1`

```c
int fibonacci(int index)
{








}
```

## Sums

Write a recursive function `sum` that, given an array `numbers` of length `length`, finds the sum of the numbers starting at index `start_index`. **You can't use loops.**

If `int x[] = {5, 6, 7}` and `int y[] = {}`, then:

* `sum(x, 3, 0)` should return `18` (5 + 6 + 7)
* `sum(x, 3, 1)` should return `13` (6 + 7)
* `sum(y, 0, 0)` should return `0`

```c
int sum(int numbers[], int length, int start_index)
{








}
```

# Pointers

## Quick review

There are three fundamental pointer operations, illustrated here with `a`, `b`, and `c`. Explain what each operation does.

**Dereference**

```c
//
//
int x = *a;
```

**Address of**

```c
//
//
int* x = &b;
```

**Assignment**

```c
//
//
*c = 5;
```

## swap

Finish this code that'll swap the values of two integers.

```c
void swap(int* a, int* b)
{
    // YOUR CODE HERE






    // END YOUR CODE
}

int main(void)
{
    int x = 1;
    int y = 2;

    // prints "x = 1, y = 2"
    printf("x = %i, y = %i\n", x, y);

    // call your swap function
    // YOUR CODE HERE


    // END YOUR CODE

    // prints "x = 2, y = 1"
    printf("x = %i, y = %i\n", x, y);
}
```

## strlen (Fall 2013 Quiz 0)

Suppose that you've forgotten which header file declares `strlen`, and so you need to re-implement it yourself. Bah. Even worse, neither `[` nor `]` currently works on your keyboard (or pencil or pen).  Without calling any functions at all  and without using any square brackets, complete the implementation of `strlen` below **using pointer arithmetic** in such a way that the function returns the length of `s`. If `s` happens to be `NULL`, your implementation of `strlen` should return 0.

```c
int strlen(char* s)
{

























}
```

# File I/O

**Opening and closing files**

<https://reference.cs50.net/stdio.h/fopen>, <https://reference.cs50.net/stdio.h/fclose>

```c
FILE* file_pointer = fopen(filename, "r");
// do stuff
fclose(file_pointer);
```

**Reading from files**

<https://reference.cs50.net/stdio.h/fread>

Reading into an array:

```c
int length = 50;
int destination[length];
fread(&destination, sizeof(int), length, file_pointer);
```

Reading into a single variable:

```c
int destination;
fread(&destination, sizeof(int), 1, file_pointer);
```

**Writing to files**

<https://reference.cs50.net/stdio.h/fwrite>

Writing from an array:

```c
int length = 50;
int source[length];
fwrite(&source, sizeof(int), length, file_pointer);
```

Writing from a single variable:

```c
int source;
fwrite(&source, sizeof(int), 1, file_pointer);
```

**Moving file pointer**

<https://reference.cs50.net/stdio.h/fseek>

```c
int distance = 50;
fseek(file_pointer, distance, SEEK_CUR);
```
