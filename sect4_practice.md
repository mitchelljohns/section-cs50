**USE HASHTABLES, NOT TRIES!** Okay you don't have to do it this way, but hashtables are way easier and tend to run faster.

## Choosing a good hash function

You'll need a hash function for `load` and `check` -- something to assign words to buckets in your hashtable. Some specifications:

* It must have a header like this: `unsigned int hash(char* word)`
* It must return an index that's less than the number of buckets, `BUCKETS` (mod `%` by `BUCKETS` to ensure this)

Don't try writing your own hash function... just adapt one off the internet. 
This is totally within bounds, just tell me where you got the function from, URL should do.
Some places you can look:

* Neel Mehta's compilation of hash functions from around the internet: <https://github.com/hathix/cs50-section/blob/master/code/7/sample-hash-functions>
* Random Stack Overflow questions like <http://stackoverflow.com/q/7666509> (search for "string hash functions for c")

## Random advice gathered from past TFs (might be a little advanced)

* Use `#define BUCKETS` for the number of buckets in your hashtable
* Check for `NULL` when you're using functions that might fail (e.g. `fopen`, `malloc`)
* Always `fclose` your files
* Avoid using `strlen` when possible because it's slow; if you're using a loop try to just compare each character to `\0`
* Eliminate function calls when possible because they take up lots of time

# Linked Lists

Linked lists are a data structure that let you keep as many elements as you want in a list. Each element (or *node*) just points to the next node.

**Solutions to all these challenges at <https://github.com/hathix/cs50-section/blob/master/code/7/linked-soln.c>**

## Create

Define a **node struct** to represent each item in the linked list:

```c
typedef struct node
{
    // the value to store in this node
    int n;

    // the link to the next node in the list
    struct node* next;
}
node;
```

Then, to **create the first element** in the linked list:

```c
node* head = malloc(sizeof(node));

// error checking: quit if malloc fails
if (head == NULL)
{
    exit(1);
}

// initialize fields in linked list
head->n = 50;
head->next = NULL;
```

## Iterate (length)

Here's a good formula for **iterating through a linked list**:

```c
// `ptr` iterates over every node starting at `head`
for (node* ptr = head; ptr != NULL; ptr = ptr->next)
{
    // do something
}
```

**Challenge**

```c
/*
 * Returns the length of the linked list that starts at `head`.
 */
int length()
{
    // **YOUR CODE HERE**









}
```

## Insert

**Challenge**

```c
/**
 * Adds an element containing `i` to the front of the linked list that
 * starts at `head`.
 */
void prepend(int i)
{
    // **YOUR CODE HERE**













}
```

## Search (contains)

**Challenge**

```c
/**\
 * Returns true if the linked list that starts at `head` contains `needle`,
 * false otherwise.
 */
bool contains(int needle)
{
    // **YOUR CODE HERE**











}
```


# Hashtables

Hashtables are just organized collections of linked lists, so once you understand linked lists, hashtables are actually pretty easy. You just assign every node to a linked list (a "bucket") and do the usual iterate/insert/search operations on the linked list.

## Create

```c

// the maximum length of a word in our hashtable
#define WORD_LENGTH 20

// number of buckets in our hash table
#define NUM_BUCKETS 100

/**
 * Each node will store an int and a pointer to the next node with the
 * same hash value (or NULL, if no such node follows).
 */
typedef struct node
{
    // what's the +1 for here?
    char word[WORD_LENGTH + 1];
    struct node* next;
}
node;


// a hashtable is an array of pointers: each pointer is the head of a linked
// list (aka bucket), and you have NUM_BUCKETS buckets stored in an array
node* hashtable[NUM_BUCKETS];
```

## Hashing

To figure out what bucket a string belongs in, run it through a **hash function**. Hash functions turn strings into integers, where the integer indicates the index of the bucket. A good hash function will minimize "collisions" in a bucket (when â‰¥1 string falls into the same bucket) by trying to make each string correspond to a unique integer.

There are a ton of good pre-made hash functions; don't try to make your own. Check out a few I've compiled at <https://github.com/hathix/cs50-section/blob/master/code/7/sample-hash-functions>.

```c
char* word = "chumbucket";
int bucket_index = hash_function(word);
```

## Insert

Inserting into a hashtable is easy: figure out what bucket the node belongs in (use the hash function) and `prepend` the node to that linked list.

## Lookup

Looking up is also easy: figure out what bucket the node belongs in (use the hash function) and `search` through that linked list's contents.
